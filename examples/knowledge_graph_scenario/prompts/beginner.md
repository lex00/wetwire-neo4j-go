I need help building a knowledge graph system for research papers.

I want to:
- Store papers, authors, concepts, and institutions
- Extract entities and relationships from paper text
- Enable semantic search on papers
- Find influential papers and research communities

Can you create the Neo4j schema and pipeline files for me?
